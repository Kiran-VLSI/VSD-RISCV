Functional Simulation of RISC-V Core | Verilog + Testbench + Waveform Analysis

Excited to share that I successfully performed a functional simulation of a RISC-V processor core using Verilog RTL and SystemVerilog Testbench! 🛠️

🔍 Key Highlights:

Simulated a synthesized RISC-V Core Verilog Netlist

Created a custom testbench to load and execute RISC-V instructions

Observed and analyzed waveforms using GTKWave/SimVision

Validated control signals, instruction flow, register updates, and memory accesses

Gained deeper insights into the datapath and instruction cycle
