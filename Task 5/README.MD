Functional Simulation of RISC-V Core | Verilog + Testbench + Waveform Analysis

Excited to share that I successfully performed a functional simulation of a RISC-V processor core using Verilog RTL and SystemVerilog Testbench! üõ†Ô∏è

Key Highlights:

1. Simulated a synthesized RISC-V Core Verilog Netlist

2. Created a custom testbench to load and execute RISC-V instructions

3. Observed and analyzed waveforms using GTKWave/SimVision

4. Validated control signals, instruction flow, register updates, and memory accesses

5. Gained deeper insights into the datapath and instruction cycle
